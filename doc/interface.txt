The REST interface is based on HTTP requests and JSON data.

In the following "localhost" is used to describe the host address and "8080" the port number.
Replace with your host address and port number.

Notice that in the following the data is shown as serialized on JSON encodings. 
Thus "/" is shown as "\/", which is just because of the escape character, which will be removed in decoding the JSON..
