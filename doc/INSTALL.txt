This document describes how to install le-mon.
You can find the le-mon source code, components and documentation at http://code.google.com/p/le-mon/.

Dependencies

The following elements are required to run le-mon
-The le-mon server (http://code.google.com/p/le-mon/)
-One or more le-mon probe-agents (http://code.google.com/p/le-mon/)
-One of more probes attached to said probe-agents (Your stuff)
-SQL database of your choice, tested with MariaDB (https://mariadb.org/)

Installation

To install le-mon, you need to configure the different elements.
The configuration for the le-mon core components is done with the le-mon.properties files for each component.
This configuration file should be placed in the working directory from which the component in question is started.
The file should be rather self-explanatory with all the comments included.
For SSH and HTTP probe-agents, the configuration of probe data is in ssh-probes.json and http-probes.json files.

You also need the jar files which the system depends on. They are in the repository/install zip.
