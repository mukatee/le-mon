This document describes how to install le-mon.
You can find the le-mon source code, components and documentation at http://code.google.com/p/le-mon/.

Dependencies

The following elements are required to run le-mon
-The le-mon server (http://code.google.com/p/le-mon/)
-One or more le-mon probe-agents (http://code.google.com/p/le-mon/)
-One of more probes attached to said probe-agents (Your stuff)
-RabbitMQ middleware (http://www.rabbitmq.com/)

Installation

To install le-mon, you need to configure the different elements.
The configuration for the le-mon core components is done with the le-mon.properties files for each component.
This configuration file should be placed in the working directory from which the component in question is started.
The file should be rather self-explanatory with all the comments included.

To install RabbitMQ, just download it for your platform and run the installer.
Afterwards, you need to start the RabbitMQ broker every time you run le-mon (or have it running).
That’s all that is needed for RabbitMQ.

you also need the jar files which the system depends on. you can download these from the hg repository or from their own websites. they are not included in the distribution zip file as it would become rather huge.
